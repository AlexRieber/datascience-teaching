# R-Tutor Problem Set 1

In the first Problem Set you get an introduction to R.

This problem set is set up as an interactive web-based problem set where you can answer every question within your browser.
Basically every problem set can be designed this way.

Give it a try in the [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1067600).
