Here we host the lecture notes and problem sets for the "Projektkurs Quantitative Wirtschaftswissenschaften" at Ulm University. This undergraduate economics course will teach students how to use real world data to base their arguments on the insighs from this data.

We have quite a heterogeneous composition in the class, however basically non of our students has a deep understanding of R, most of them have never used R before. Hence we start very basic and aim at providing students with enough knowledge to do an entire project in R. 

To achive this we do weekly assignments where students have to solve problem sets on their own. If you like R programming, take a look at the folder Problem-Sets that contains RTutor problemsets.

## Problem Sets

The topics include:

- Problem Set 1: Basic introduction to R and a short introduction to ggplot as well as a small introduction to data frames
- Problem Set 2: Basic introduction how to get data into R, join different datasets and manipulate datasets. Here we introduce the basic dyplr syntax.
- Problem Set 3: Introduction to ggplot and how to make plots effective and visually appealing. Animated graphs as well as maps are also included in this section.
- Problem Set 4: Introduction to linear regression, standard errors, confidence intervals and the interpretation of coefficients.
- Problem Set 5: Introduction to causality with monte-carlo simulations and real world data.

(To motivate students to solve the problem sets, they are grade-relevant to a small extend. Therefore I don't want solutions too easily available.)
